## 🧬 Overview
**Blood 'n Meat** (also known as *Blood 'n Flesh*) is a **hybrid semi-technology/magic Minecraft mod** where players harvest the essence of life and death — *blood and flesh* — to advance into a world of dark alchemy, techno-organic machines, and corruption.

You can follow the path of the **Living Flesh**, the **Undead Flesh**, or **merge both** to master the forbidden art of **blood-powered techno-magic**.
